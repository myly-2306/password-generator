## random secured password generator

This exercise started with html and css written, I wrote javascript so the computer understands the selections users want to include in their passwords.

When users hit generate password, a pop-up box will ask for the amount of characters they want to include and if they want anywhere less than 8 and more than 128, a warning will pop up to let them know because the password can't be shorter than 8 or more than 128.

After they put down how many character they want to have, they will have to choose what criteria to include in the password. If they want to inlcude UPPERCASE, lowercse, numbers and special characters, they can do that by simply clicking ok for yes, or cancel for no.

In the end, they will be given a password with chosen character length, mixed criteria and randomly picked character.

This is how it looks when you run it

This is how it will look if you choose 9 character long and include all criteria
